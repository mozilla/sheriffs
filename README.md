Mozilla Sheriff Duty
====================

This app is all about Mozilla build engineers taking turns to be
"Sheriff". The core of this application is a roster of users and dates
which can be swapped around and repeated.
Mozilla's Playdoh is a web application template based on [Django][django].

The original requirement came from [this bug][bug].
